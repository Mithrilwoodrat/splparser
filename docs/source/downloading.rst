Downloading
===========

Checkout the code at the `splparser <https://github.com/salspaugh/splparser>`_ Github repository. 
For example, run::

    git clone git@github.com:salspaugh/splparser.git

There are much older versions of the parser `available through PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/splparser/0.2.0>`_
but these are currently outdated, so it is recommended that you check out the Github version instead.
